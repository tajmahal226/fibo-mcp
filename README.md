Paste into Claude Code:
```
Install fibo-mcp from https://github.com/NeuroFusionAI/fibo-mcp
```

## GitHub Codespaces

Open this repository in a Codespace for instant setup:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/tajmahal226/fibo-mcp)

Everything is pre-configured! The devcontainer will automatically:
- Install `uv` package manager
- Install all Python dependencies
- Set up VS Code with Python extensions
- Pre-download FIBO data

See [.devcontainer/README.md](.devcontainer/README.md) for details.

## Installation

If already in fibo-mcp directory, skip clone and cd. Run all commands from the fibo-mcp directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NeuroFusionAI/fibo-mcp.git && cd fibo-mcp
uv sync
claude mcp add --scope user fibo-mcp -- uv run --directory "$(pwd)" main.py
# Restart Claude Code to load the MCP
```

### With OWL-RL Materialization (Recommended for symbolic reasoning)

Materialization expands the graph from 130K → 616K triples with inferred facts. First run takes ~2 minutes, then cached.

```bash
# Step 1: Build cache first (Ctrl+C after "Ready to serve")
uv run main.py --materialize

# Step 2: Add MCP (instant startup from cache)
claude mcp add --scope user fibo-mcp -- uv run --directory "$(pwd)" main.py --materialize
```

### Diagramming Skill

The repo includes a diagramming skill (`.claude/skills/diagramming_expert/`) for ASCII visualizations.

When installing via Claude Code, ask user:

> **Diagramming skill scope:**
> - [ ] Project scope only (default - already in .claude/skills/)
> - [ ] User scope (all projects) - copy to ~/.claude/skills/

```bash
# User scope skill (optional)
cp -r .claude/skills/diagramming_expert ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Other MCP Clients (Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.)

Add to your MCP config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fibo-mcp": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/path/to/fibo-mcp", "main.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

With materialization:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fibo-mcp": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/path/to/fibo-mcp", "main.py", "--materialize"]
    }
  }
}
```

> Build cache first: `uv run main.py --materialize` (Ctrl+C after "Ready to serve")

### Uninstall

```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp remove fibo-mcp

# Remove user-scope skill (if installed)
rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/diagramming-expert
```

### "What is money?"

Money is a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account that facilitates economic transactions.

**Forms of Money:**
- Commodity money - Physical items with intrinsic value (gold, silver)
- Fiat money - Government-issued currency not backed by commodity (USD, EUR)
- Digital/Electronic money - Bank deposits, digital payments
- Cryptocurrencies - Decentralized digital assets like Bitcoin

Money's value ultimately rests on collective trust and acceptance.

According to FIBO:

**Currency**: *"medium of exchange value, defined by reference to the geographical location of the monetary authorities responsible for it"*

FIBO distinguishes:
- **Currency** - the medium of exchange itself
- **Monetary Amount** - a quantity denominated in a currency
- **Currency Identifier** - ISO 4217 codes (USD, EUR, etc.)

A country is a distinct territorial body or political entity with its own government, defined borders, and sovereignty.

**Key characteristics:**
- Defined territory
- Permanent population

**Sovereign State**: *"non-physical juridical entity that is represented by one centralized government that has sovereignty over a geographic area"*

Key characteristics from FIBO:
- Represented by one centralized government
- Has a permanent population
- Has defined territory
- Has capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states

## Why FIBO?

Finance has a semantics problem—the same "trade," "counterparty," or "position" can mean different things across desks, systems, vendors, and jurisdictions. FIBO provides a formal, machine-readable ontology (OWL/RDF) so data from contracts, market feeds, and internal systems can be integrated and queried with shared meaning.

Contributors include Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, State Street, Wells Fargo, CFTC, US Treasury OFR, and others. Standardized by EDM Council and OMG.

## Remote MCP (OpenAI, etc.)

```bash
# Start HTTP server
uv run main.py --http --port 8000

# Expose via ngrok (in another terminal)
ngrok http 8000
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
resp = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5.2",
    tools=[{
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "fibo",
        "server_url": "https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/mcp",
        "require_approval": "never",
    }],
    input="What is a derivative according to FIBO?",
)
```
